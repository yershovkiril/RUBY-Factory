#### Please implement your own class 'Factory' which will have the same behavior as ['Struct'](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Struct.html) class.

Customer = Struct.new(:name, :address, :zip)
=> Customer
 
joe = Customer.new("Joe Smith", "123 Maple, Anytown NC", 12345)
=> #<struct Customer name="Joe Smith", address="123 Maple, Anytown NC", zip=12345>
 
joe.name
joe["name"]
joe[:name]
joe[0]
=> "Joe Smith"

-----------

Customer = Struct.new(:name, :address) do
  def greeting
    "Hello #{name}!"
  end
end
Customer.new("Dave", "123 Main").greeting
=> "Hello Dave!"
